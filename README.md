# Image-Recognition - University CourseWork

Comparing different methods of image recognition on the CIFAR-10 image set.

Methods used:
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- NN (Neural Network)

The 3 methods were also compared using two different kinds of labels; Coarse labels (superclass) and fine labels (subclass).

# File is easier to look through in an IDE as you can close down some of the larger outputs.
